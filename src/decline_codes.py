"""Decline/error taxonomy grounded in Razorpay public documentation.

Razorpay error objects include ``code``, ``description``, ``source``, ``step``,
and ``reason`` (see https://razorpay.com/docs/errors/).

This module keys off the documented ``reason`` strings. Names are copied from:

- https://razorpay.com/docs/errors/reasons/
- https://razorpay.com/docs/errors/payments/cards/

We do **not** invent Razorpay-specific reason strings.

Retry categories (SOFT_RETRY / HARD_FAILURE / DO_NOT_RETRY) and synthetic
retry behaviour are **prototype policy**, except where public docs explicitly
tell the customer to retry after some time. See each catalog entry's
``classification_note``.
